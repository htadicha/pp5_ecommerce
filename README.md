### 🔗 Key Relationships Explained

#### **1. User Management Relationships**

**Account ↔ UserProfile (One-to-One)**
- Each user account has exactly one profile
- Profile contains extended user information (address, profile picture)
- **Business Logic**: When a user registers, a profile is automatically created

**Account ↔ ReviewRating (One-to-Many)**
- One user can write multiple reviews
- Each review belongs to exactly one user
- **Business Logic**: Users can review products they've purchased

#### **2. Product Management Relationships**

**Category ↔ Product (One-to-Many)**
- One category can contain multiple products
- Each product belongs to exactly one category
- **Business Logic**: Products are organized by categories for easy navigation

**Product ↔ Variation (One-to-Many)**
- One product can have multiple variations (color, size)
- Each variation belongs to exactly one product
- **Business Logic**: Products can have different options (e.g., Red/Blue, S/M/L)

**Product ↔ ProductGallery (One-to-Many)**
- One product can have multiple gallery images
- Each gallery image belongs to exactly one product
- **Business Logic**: Products can have multiple images for better presentation

#### **3. Shopping Cart Relationships**

**Account ↔ CartItem (One-to-Many)**
- One user can have multiple cart items
- Each cart item belongs to exactly one user (if authenticated)
- **Business Logic**: Users can add multiple products to their cart

**Cart ↔ CartItem (One-to-Many)**
- One cart can contain multiple items
- Each cart item belongs to exactly one cart
- **Business Logic**: Cart persists across sessions using cart_id

**Product ↔ CartItem (One-to-Many)**
- One product can be in multiple cart items
- Each cart item contains exactly one product
- **Business Logic**: Same product can be in different users' carts

#### **4. Order Management Relationships**

**Account ↔ Order (One-to-Many)**
- One user can place multiple orders
- Each order belongs to exactly one user
- **Business Logic**: Users can have order history

**Payment ↔ Order (One-to-One)**
- Each order has exactly one payment

#### **5. Review System Relationships**

**Product ↔ ReviewRating (One-to-Many)**
- One product can receive multiple reviews
- Each review belongs to exactly one product
- **Business Logic**: Products can have multiple customer reviews

### 📊 Database Design Principles

#### **Normalization**
- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: All attributes contain atomic values
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: No partial dependencies
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: No transitive dependencies

#### **Indexing Strategy**
```sql
-- Primary Keys (Auto-indexed)
CREATE INDEX idx_account_email ON Account(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_slug ON Product(slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_category_slug ON Category(slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_number ON Order(order_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_id ON Payment(payment_id);
```

#### **Foreign Key Constraints**
- **CASCADE**: When parent is deleted, child records are deleted
- **SET_NULL**: When parent is deleted, child foreign key is set to NULL
- **RESTRICT**: Prevents deletion of parent if child records exist

### 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

```
User Registration → Account Creation → Profile Creation
Product Browsing → Category Selection → Product View
Cart Addition → CartItem Creation → Session Management
Order Placement → Payment Processing → Order Creation
Review Submission → ReviewRating Creation → Product Rating Update
```

### 📈 Performance Considerations

#### **Query Optimization**
- **Eager Loading**: Use `select_related()` for foreign key relationships
- **Prefetch Loading**: Use `prefetch_related()` for many-to-many relationships
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields

#### **Caching Strategy**
- **Product Cache**: Cache frequently accessed products
- **Category Cache**: Cache category hierarchies
- **User Session Cache**: Cache user cart and preferences
